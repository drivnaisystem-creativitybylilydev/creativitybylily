# Square Setup Guide for Creativity by Lily

Hi Lily! 👋

This guide will walk you through the steps to connect your Square account to your new website. Don't worry — since you already have Square for your in-person sales, this is quick and easy!

**Time needed:** About 10-15 minutes

---

## What We're Doing

We're connecting your existing Square account to your website so you can:
- ✅ Accept credit card payments online
- ✅ See all your sales (online + in-person) in one Square dashboard
- ✅ Get payouts to the same bank account you already use

---

## Step 1: Log Into Square

1. Go to [squareup.com](https://squareup.com)
2. Click **Sign In** in the top right
3. Log in with your Square account (the same one you use for in-person sales)

---

## Step 2: Make Sure Online Payments Are Enabled

1. Once logged in, click the **Settings** gear icon (⚙️)
2. Look for **Business** or **Account & Settings**
3. Find **Online Payments** or **eCommerce**
4. Make sure it shows as **Enabled**

*If it's not enabled, there should be a button to turn it on — it's usually instant since your account is already verified.*

---

## Step 3: Go to the Square Developer Dashboard

This is where we get the "keys" that connect your website to Square.

1. Open a new tab and go to: **[developer.squareup.com](https://developer.squareup.com)**
2. Click **Sign In** (use the same Square account)
3. You'll see the Developer Dashboard

---

## Step 4: Create an Application

1. Click the **"+"** button or **"Create Application"**
2. Name it: **Creativity by Lily Website**
3. Click **Save** or **Create**

---

## Step 5: Get Your API Credentials

Once your application is created, we need to collect 3 things. I'll help you find each one:

### 5a. Application ID
- On the main application page, look for **Application ID**
- It looks like: `sq0idp-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
- **Copy this and share it with me on the call**

### 5b. Access Token (Production)
1. Click on the **Credentials** tab (or **OAuth** tab)
2. Look for **Production Access Token**
3. You may need to click **"Show"** or **"Create Token"**
4. It looks like: `EAAAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
5. **Copy this and share it with me on the call**

⚠️ **Important:** This token is like a password — don't share it with anyone except me during our call!

### 5c. Location ID
1. Click on the **Locations** tab
2. You'll see your business location listed
3. Copy the **Location ID** (looks like: `LXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)
4. **Share this with me on the call**

---

## Step 6: Share the Credentials With Me (On Our Call)

During our call, please have these 3 things ready to share with me:

| What | Looks Like | Where to Find |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Application ID | `sq0idp-XXX...` | Main app page |
| Access Token | `EAAA...` | Credentials tab |
| Location ID | `LXXX...` | Locations tab |

I'll securely add these to your website, and then we can test a payment together!

---

## What Happens Next

Once I have these credentials:
1. I'll add them to your website (takes about 5 minutes)
2. We'll do a small test payment together to make sure it works
3. Your website will be ready to accept real payments! 🎉

All payments will show up in your regular Square Dashboard, right alongside your in-person sales.
