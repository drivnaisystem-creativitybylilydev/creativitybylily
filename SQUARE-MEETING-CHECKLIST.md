## 🗣️ Quick Talking Points

If client asks questions:

**"Why do you need these?"**
→ "These keys connect your website to your Square account so online payments go to the same place as your in-person sales."

**"Is this secure?"**
→ "Yes! Square handles all card data securely. Your website never sees card numbers - Square sends back a secure token."

**"How long will this take?"**
→ "About 10-15 minutes to get the keys, then I'll integrate them into the website. We can test with a small payment after."

**"Will this affect my current Square setup?"**
→ "No! This just adds online payments. Your in-person sales continue exactly as they are."
